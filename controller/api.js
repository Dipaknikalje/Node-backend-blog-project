        "MISSION MAJNU is the story of an Indian spy in Pakistan. In 1974, India successfully conducted nuclear tests, shocking the world. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (Rajit Kapur) is upset. At the advice of ISI Chief Maqsood Alam (Shishir Sharma), Pakistan decides to invite Abdul Qadeer Khan (Mir Sarwar), a nuclear scientist based in the Netherlands. A Q Khan is given the responsibility of building an atomic bomb and Pakistan plans to secure its parts from the black market. RAW’s chief R N Kao (Parmeet Sethi) learns that Pakistan is upto some mischief. With the approval of the Prime Minister of India (Avantika Akerkar), he informs his secret agent in Rawalpindi, Amandeep Singh aka Tariq (Sidharth Malhotra) to find out more details and the whereabouts of the atom bomb facility. Tariq is working as a tailor and has successfully created his image of a good-natured simpleton. Hence, no one has the slightest doubt that he’s a spy. He falls in love with Nasreen (Rashmika Mandanna), a blind girl and both get married. Tariq works at the tailor shop of Nasreen’s uncle Momin (Manoj Bakshi) and they often get the order of stitching clothes for the Pakistani army. Tariq uses this opportunity to speak to the Pakistani brigadier and finds out information about the bomb and who is the scientist who’s spearheading it. His mission isn’t easy as he needs to be very careful that the Pakistani army or the intelligence does not find out the truth about him. Moreover, he has a tragic past. His father was caught selling sensitive defence information about India to Pakistan. Tariq’s handler Sharma (Zakir Hussain) in Delhi leaves no opportunity to remind him that he’s the son of a traitor. Moreover, Tariq is not expected to marry and fall in love. Yet, he is crazily in love with Nasreen and they are also expecting a child. What happens next forms the rest of the film.",

Om readily agrees and expresses the desire to click a picture with Vijay. Hence, he asks Vijay to arrive at the RTO office. Vijay agrees. When he reaches the RTO office, Vijay is shocked to see that the media has already arrived. A narrative is spread that Vijay never had a driving licence and that all these years, he was illegally driving a car. Assuming that Om called the media, Vijay blasts him and leaves. An angry Om stops him from driving the car, citing that he doesn't possess a driving license. The moment is captured by the media.

A team headquartered at Boston Children’s Hospital is implementing machine learning to scour through social posts, news reports, data from official public health channels and information supplied by doctors for warning signs that the virus is taking hold in locations outside of China. “There’s incredible data that’s locked away in various tools like online news sites, social media, crowdsourcing, data sources, that you wouldn’t think of that would be used for public health,” said Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital. “But actually they have incredible amounts of information that you wouldn’t find in any sort of traditional government system.” While others in Australian region are using predictive analytics, a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), to forecast how many confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths can be expected in the near future. According to this, by March 13, the virus death toll will have climbed to 3,913, and confirmed cases will reach 116,250 worldwide, based on data available up to March 5. To develop contingency plans and hopefully head off the worst effects of the coronavirus, governments need to be able to anticipate the future course of the outbreak.

Hospitals and government are turning to industries to come up with innovative ways of resolving this pandemic induced emergency. Automaker legend Volkswagen is using 3D printing to produce face shield components. This aid comes under a joint transnational initiative by Airbus and the 3D printing network, “Mobility goes Additive”. This collaboration includes about 25 companies.

Both the founders have taken a retreat from their active management from the company after 21 years. In a blog that published on Tuesday, Page and Brin quoted, “While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it’s time to assume the role of proud parents offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!” It will be interesting to see how Pichai will lead Alphabet which owns over a dozen companies including self-driving car technology business Waymo and health care software company Verily. However, all three leaders have expressed their keenness towards developing and advancing AI software to enhance web searching and other tasks. The new CEO, over time, has made significant efforts in making such technologies globally available. Amid this, as per the investors, streamlining management could also help Alphabet better address challenges and put more focus on growing profits.

Now, at the point when “quantum” is applied to “computing,” nonetheless, we are without a doubt entering a time of emotional progression with dramatic advancement. Quantum computing is an innovation that is dependent on the standards and principles of quantum theory, which clarifies the idea of energy and matter on the atomic and subatomic levels. It depends on the presence of mind-bending quantum-mechanical phenomena, like superposition and entanglement. Erwin Schrödinger’s popular 1930’s psychological experiment including a cat that was both dead and alive simultaneously was expected to feature the evident idiocy of superposition, the rule that quantum frameworks can exist in various states at the same time until noticed or estimated. Today, quantum computers contain many qubits (quantum bits), which exploit that very rule. Each qubit exists in a superposition of zero and one (for example has non-zero probabilities to be a zero or a one) until estimated.",

        "Regular exercise is a prescription for staying healthy and active as you age. But sometimes it’s not that easy. Many older adults face an injury, illness, health condition, or disability that makes activities difficult, if not seemingly impossible. If you are in this category, adaptive sports could be a welcome opportunity.Eventually, almost everyone will experience some kind of disability that impedes regular exercise, whether it’s mild arthritis, a joint problem requiring knee or hip replacement, limited vision, or a more significant physical disability,says Dr. Cheri Blauwet, an associate professor in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School and a former wheelchair racer,",

It's prime time for open water swimming, running, cycling, hiking, and anything else that gets me outside and moving. Yet, my first step is to get my legs in shape.Legs are the foundation for most activities, says Vijay Daryanani, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. They're home to some of the body’s largest muscles, and building healthy legs can improve one’s performance, reduce injury, and increase endurance.",

Just don’t assume that they’re healthier, because no strong evidence supports claims of weight loss, heart health, or cancer prevention.These beverages are best enjoyed plain or with only a touch of lemon, honey, unsweetened milk, or plant milk. Processing and added ingredients can negate any health-promoting effects from naturally-occurring plant compounds. For example, some research suggests that adding protein and fat to tea through milk or creamer can reduce antioxidant properties and might deactivate flavonoids.",
